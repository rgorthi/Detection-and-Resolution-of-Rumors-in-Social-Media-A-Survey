# Detection-and-Resolution-of-Rumors-in-Social-Media-A-Survey
This project addresses the challenge
of rumor stance classification, which involves
identifying the stances of users towards the
veracity of a rumor. Stance classification is
considered to be an important step towards
rumor verification, therefore performing well in
this task is expected to be useful in debunking
false rumors. In this work we classify a set of
Twitter posts discussing rumors into either
supporting, denying, questioning, or
commenting on the underlying rumors. We
propose an LSTM-based sequential model
which takes in the sequences of source and their
corresponding reply tweets as input and gives
stances for all the underlying tweets.
